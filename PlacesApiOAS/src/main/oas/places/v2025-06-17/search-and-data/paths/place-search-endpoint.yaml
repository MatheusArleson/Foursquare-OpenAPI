      summary: Place Search
      description: |-
        Search for places in the FSQ Places database using a location and querying by name, category name, telephone number, taste label, or chain name. For example, search for "coffee" to get back a list of recommended coffee shops.
        You may pass a location with your request by using one of the following options. If none of the following options are passed, Place Search defaults to geolocation using ip biasing with the optional radius parameter.
        ll & radius (circular boundary)
        near (geocodable locality)
        ne & sw (rectangular boundary)
